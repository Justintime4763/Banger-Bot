# Banger-Bot

Banger bot is a open-source alternative to music bots made for discord. While many music bots on discord function well enough, they often have a paywall to certain features such as volume. This project is a work in progress, and will probably not have some of those features implemented until a later date, however.

### Dependencies

Since this project uses python, all dependencies can be installed via the ``pip`` command.
All dependencies used:
- discord.py[voice]   (https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
- youtube_dl    (https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)

To install use ``pip install "discord.py[voice]" "youtube_dl"``.
